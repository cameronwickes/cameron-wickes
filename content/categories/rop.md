description: Return Oriented Programming is a technique used by attackers to
  exploit binaries with NX protection. The NX bit marks areas of data, such as
  the stack and heap as non-executable, meaning stack-based shellcode exploits
  will not work. Instead, we chain together instructions already found in the
  program to achieve code execution.
