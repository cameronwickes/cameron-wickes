Every day, from the 1st up to the 24th of December, the folks over at River Security released a small capture the flag (CTF) challenge for members of the community to solve. The goal was to solve as many doors from the advent calendar over at <https://rsxc.no> as possible, and submit the write-up by December 27th.
