In July 2019, I got the amazing opportunity to take part in a 6-day SANS GIAC course, SEC504 - Hacker Tools, Techniques, Exploits, and Incident Handling. It was a truly awesome experience, that provided a lot of great memories, as well as buckets and buckets of knowledge about the subject. 

In August, I took and passed my GCIH exam (much to my delight), with a score of 94%. I’m going to share my experiences and some lessons I learnt whilst studying and practicing for this qualification.

**The Course** 

The six-day mega-marathon of a course is a fantastic way to expand your knowledge of an area in a rapid amount of time. Each day is dynamic, unique and covers completely different ground, so if you are thinking of taking one, or have booked one, expect the unexpected, and be prepared to LEARN. Doing a SANS course is not a breeze. As many people like to say, it’s like “drinking from the fire hose”, and that’s a great description of it. The instructors are great, and the courses are designed to get you to engrain information. Instructors provide those extra levels of detail and personal anecdotes which help you remember important nuggets that you may need in the exam, so I would highly recommend booking an in-person course, because it’s not the same through a screen. Here are a few bits and pieces I picked up on how to optimise your learning experience:

1. Try to stay engaged. You might find that there are times of the day that you start to dip, so keep hydrated, and find a way to keep that intake of information going. For me, actively highlighting key words in the book really helped me to keep on track throughout the day. It also made things easier when I revisited the books later!
2. Don’t be afraid to participate in the class. There will be many opportunities for you to answer questions, chime in and discuss topics. Doing so improves your understanding of the topic and allows your mind to articulate and process the content.
3. Ask questions if you don’t understand. This may seem obvious, but when sitting in a room with other cyber enthusiasts, it may seem daunting to do so. If you’ve never heard of something, or don’t quite understand how something operates, make sure you know before the instructor moves on. Quite often the next slide will build upon the previous, and you don’t want to fall behind…
4. At the end of the day, consolidate the information you gained throughout the day. Re-read the books or look things up so you are fully confident to move on from it the next day. 

On the last day of the course, there is usually an opportunity to partake in a CTF or similar, where you get to apply everything you’ve learnt throughout the course. It will stand you in good stead to have been active, aware and participating in previous days. Who knows, you might even win a coveted challenge coin if you’re good enough!

### **At Home Study**

After the course, you will have a four-month window to take your certification attempt. It won’t be easy, but if you put in the required work and effort, you’ll take home a score you are satisfied with. I will detail below how I did at-home study, and how it helped me to pass my certification attempt.

**Indexing** 

For indexing, I followed the Pancakes Indexing System developed by Hacks4Pancakes. I will give a brief rundown of how it works, but if you want a full explanation, you can read the full article through the link above. To do this, I used the following:

* [Post-It Tabs](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Post-Markers-Self-adhesive-document-assorted/dp/B00H2DNLUY/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=post+it+tabs&qid=1586908400&s=officeproduct&sr=1-4) 
* [Stabilo Highlighters](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Highlighter-STABILO-ORIGINAL-Assorted-Colours/dp/B01LXOQ1KJ/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=highlighters+pastel&qid=1586909532&s=officeproduct&sr=1-4)

To start, I assigned each book a different base colour. This helped to quickly identify which book a topic is in. I then rifled through each book, placing a different coloured tab at the start of each chapter, and wrote down what the chapter was on the tab. This helped to flick to certain sections, and allowed identification of which chapter a certain topic was in. I then proceeded to read through the books with a careful eye, highlighting key words on each page. I used different colours for different types of information. For me, I used purple for commands, yellow for keywords and blue for tools, but it’s completely up to you.
Following that, I filled in my excel index with the book, page number, keyword and description. Shown below is an excerpt so you can see the style I went for:

N.B. Make sure to read through every part of the page when indexing. Quite often questions will test what’s in the note section at the bottom, and not what is on the slide, so make sure to read THOROUGHLY.  

**Practice Tests**

Most GIAC courses provide two practice tests for you to complete. They are the most accurate indicator of what the final exam is like and allow you to identify weak topics in your learning. 

Practice Test 1: Took after a couple weeks of studying and a few long days of indexing. The aim of this practice test was to get me used to the questioning style and general feel of the exam. I did panic a bit at the start, but eased into it towards the end, and found my flow. I took 01:50:24 and passed with 80%.

It was at this point that I booked my examination. I gained a passing score on the first practice test and didn’t want to lose the information that was already in my head, so I chose the earliest possible date!

I took a day to review what information I had gathered from the practice test. By default, practice tests show you if you get a question wrong, and what the right answer was with an explanation. I copied and pasted these into a document and used this to review my performance at the end. I did some analysis of the questions I got wrong and identified a reason why for each. There were also points within the test where I went to look up an index item but couldn’t find it. I jotted each of these down and reviewed why I couldn’t find them. Sometimes, I completely missed it off my index, and other times I had named it in a way which wasn’t easily accessible during exam conditions.

Practice Test 2: Took the day before the scheduled attempt. The aim of this test was to improve on areas I didn’t do so well in and push towards that 90% boundary. I took 01:48:25 and passed with 91%. The second test went much better than the first, and I felt I had a good underlying grasp of the topics covered. However, there were still a few spots where the information wasn’t easy to find. I took the opportunity to print off cheat sheets with handy information on that I may have needed in the exam (remember: the exam is open book).

**The Exam** 

This is the moment you’ve been anticipating. Make sure to get some good sleep the night before and wake up reasonably early. I found it useful to exercise before I headed to the centre, gave my head some space and allowed my mind to consolidate information from the days of studying previously.

I got to the centre about an hour and a half early, so scoped out the place, then went to find a good cup of coffee! I headed up about half an hour before the time, making sure to triple check I had all the required documents. 

I found the exam similar difficulty to the practice tests, but there were a few questions that tripped me up, and I had to skip a few along the way. I ended up taking 03:01:32 to complete my certification attempt, almost double the time I took on my practice tests. This was partly just to triple check with every question that I had the right answer, but there were a few tricky labs that took a bit of time. I managed to pass with a score of 94%. An excellent result.

**Conclusions** 

The GIAC certification was one of the most interesting, and challenging learning experiences I have partaken in, and it required a lot of different techniques to overcome obstacles. 

Believe in yourself, keep pushing for what you want, and don’t give up!

Best of luck to those taking GIAC exams, I hope this guide was informative and helped give insight into my study method.
