Recently, the GIAC GCIA Gold Paper I have been working on for 6 months has been approved and published in the SANS Reading Room. This is the first of two papers I aim to publish before I reach the end of University. The abstract can be seen below:

*"With almost 40% of UK businesses experiencing a cyber-attack in 2020, the need for accurate and rapid detection of attacks is evident. However, traditional signature-based IDS systems are inefficient at detecting advanced threats due to the time involved in verifying and distributing signatures. Similarly, first-generation SIEM systems show limitations when processing big data, and sophisticated attacks go undetected. This paper introduces and explores large-scale data analysis and machine learning tools within intrusion detection."*
