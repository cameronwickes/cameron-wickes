*MA1SD is a federated Matrix identity server that maps Matrix IDs to Third-Party Identifiers (3PIDs) which connects to existing on-premise identity stores such as Active Directory, LDAP, SQL Databases and Web Applications. It implements the Matrix Identity-Service API and is designed for self-hosted Synapse instances.*
