          <h3>Hi!</h3>
          <p>Iâ€™m Cameron Wickes, an 18-year-old student from Cumbria, with a love for computers and information security.</p>
          <p>My journey into infosec started a couple of years ago, when a friend introduced me to an online cybersecurity course. Having loved Computer Science throughout my seven years at secondary school, I immediately jumped at the idea had completed the course within a couple of days.</p>
          <p>I am always trying to expand my knowledge of the subject, in whatever form that may be, but I am particularly interested in developing areas such as User Behaviour and Entity Analytics, or Malware Analysis using Machine Learning. I find this stuff really cool!</p>
          <p>Python is my go-to programming language, due to its flexibility and speed, but I have a background in VB.NET, and am currently learning C. I enjoy solving problems with a creative approach, which is why the unlimited possibilities of coding appeal to me, but cybersecurity also allows me to delve into advanced theoretical and academic topics, which I find highly stimulating.</p>
          <p>Through HMG and the SANS institute, I got the chance to participate in and complete the SANS SEC504 course, which I enjoyed thoroughly. I hope to get the chance to participate in more events like these over the coming years.</p>
          <p>This blog serves as a space to share and collate my personal learning experiences as I progress in the field, in the hopes to provide a space where up and coming enthusiasts can find relevant material.</p>
